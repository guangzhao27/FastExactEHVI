# FastExactEHVI

THe repository is related to the paper:    
[A fast exact algorithm calculating Expected HyperVolume Improvement (EHVI)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07692.pdf)

All the code is verified on the terminal of MacOs.

Data is downloaded from [Walking Fish Group](http://www.wfg.csse.uwa.edu.au/hypervolume/)

FPL-based algorithm comes from the decomposition method [FPL](http://lopez-ibanez.eu/hypervolume)
